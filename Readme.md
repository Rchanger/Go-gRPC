# Go-gRPC
This is simple demonstration of how grpc is to be used with golang.

## Setting up the environment required for grpc.
1. Download and install protoc form below link:
  ~~~ 
  https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
  ~~~
2. Next, install Go support for Googleâ€™s protocol buffers and grpc:
  ~~~
  go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
  go install github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
  go get google.golang.org/grpc
  ~~~

## Running Demo examples.
1. Unary gRPC is explained with example of addition and subtraction example.You will find the example inside __SimpleGRPC__ directory.
For simple/unary grpc sample.pb.go file is generated by executing following command:
 ~~~ 
 protoc -I ProtoDir/  ./ProtoDir/sample.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:ProtoDir/ 
 ~~~ 

2. Server Side Streaming type of grpc is explained with the help of small example of finding Divisors of number.It is present under __ServerSideStreaming__ directory.
For server side streaming grpc serverStreamingProto.pb.go file is generated by executing following command:
 ~~~
 protoc -I ServerSideStreaming/ServerSideStreamingProto/     ./ServerSideStreaming/ServerSideStreamingProto/serverStreamingProto.proto --    go_out=plugins=grpc:ServerSideStreaming/ServerSideStreamingProto/
 ~~~

3. Client Side Streaming type of grpc is explained with the help of small example of finding max number from stream of number.The example is present under __ClientSideStramingGRPC__ directory.
For client side streaming grpc clientstraming.pb.go file is generated by executing following command:
 ~~~
 protoc -I ClientSideStramingGRPC/ClientSideStramingProto/ ./ClientSideStramingGRPC/ClientSideStramingProto/clientstraming.proto -- go_out=plugins=grpc:ClientSideStramingGRPC/ClientSideStramingProto/
 ~~~ 

4. Bidirectional Streaming type of grpc is explained with the help of small example of finding max number from stream of number.The example is present under __BiDirectionGRPC__ directory.
For bidirectional streaming grpc bidirctionalProto.pb.go file is generated by executing following command:
 ~~~
 protoc -I BiDirectionGRPC/BiDirProto/  ./BiDirectionGRPC/BiDirProto/bidirctionalProto.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:BiDirectionGRPC/BiDirProto/
 ~~~
